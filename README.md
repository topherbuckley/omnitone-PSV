# omnitone-PSV
Demonstration of combining Photo-Sphere-Viewer with omitone for web-based VR with spatial audio. 

<h1>Installation</h1>
Clone or copy repo.

Install npm if you don't have it 

(This is system specific and not covered here, though for linux I use)

```
sudo apt install npm
```

and install all dependencies using npm

```
npm install
```


<h1>Running</h1>

Should work on newest Firefox if run on localhost, but if not, run local server with python 3.?.? using:

```
# python3 -m http.server 8000
```

You can of course use another local or live http server as well. 

Then point broswer to 0.0.0.0:8000/index.html
